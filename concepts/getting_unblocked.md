# Getting unblocked.

I've written an interactive tutorial on this:

> [Finding motivation when you're blocked](http://YourFirstProduct.com/Tools/Productive)

Also, using [kv](http://www.secretgeek.net/kv), I have a template that I use:

    kv unblock "# VISION

    # PROJECT/CUSTOMER

    # TASKS

    # ISSUES

I paste that into my journal and fill out enough of it that I can move forward.
