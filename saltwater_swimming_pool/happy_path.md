# The happy path

If all is going well with your saltwater swimming pool you will still need to regularly add:

1. water (if hot/dry conditions lower the level)
2. salt (a few bags over summer)
3. hydrochloric acid (approx a cup per weak)
4. uric acid

And you will need to regularly:

1. empty the baskets (1-7 days)
2. test the pool (1-7 days)
3. backwash the filter (monthly)
4. rinse the filter (when backwashing)
5. de-calcify the chlorinator (1-3 months)

And vacuum the pool (if you don't have an automated vaccum or robot butler)





You will need to perform a lot more maintenance in summer than winter.



And when things go wrong you may need to add:

1. chlorine (aka shock)
2. alkaline (aka buffer)
3. phosphate remover (aka starver)
4. (aka clarifier)
5. Flocculant
