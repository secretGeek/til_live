# apt-get package management

to list all packages installed locally...


    dpkg --get-selections | grep -v deinstall

or, simply:

    dpkg -l
 
 
To update apt-get...

    sudo apt-get update


To install somethink...

    sudo apt-get install unzip

To check if any packages need to be updated....

    sudo apt-get -u upgrade --assume-no

(If you leave off the ` --assume-no` then it will prompt you to upgrade, and will default to Y)    
    
To upgrade packages

    sudo apt-get upgrade


When asked:

        Do you want to continue [Y/n]

The capital 'Y' means it is the default. So for 'Yes' just press enter.


If your machine says something like:

    27 packages can be updated.
    14 updates are security updates.

Then you may perform an upgrade, with `sudo apt-get -u upgrade --assume-no` as above.


After performing an upgrade, you may have messages like this:


    The following packages have been kept back:
      linux-headers-generic linux-headers-virtual linux-image-virtual linux-virtual snapd
      ubuntu-core-launcher
    0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 6 not upgraded.


What is this 'kept back' business?

It means that some of the packages were not upgraded, because their dependencies would've needed to be upgraded too.

To update just a single package, and only if it is already installed....

	apt-get install --only-upgrade <packagename>
	
e.g. 

	sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade python-certbot-nginx
