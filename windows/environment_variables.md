# Environment variables -- view/edit them on windows


* From cmd.exe, type `SET` and you'll see the value of all environment variables
* From Powershell, `Set-Location Env:`
* From **Windows**, method 1
    * Press `[Windows`]`[Break`] -- this brings up `Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\System`
    * Click "Advanced System settings" (you'll need to enter Admin password or elevate) and you'll get to "System Properties"
        * Advanced tab: click "Environment Variables..."
            * There you have "user variables for current user" and "System variables"
            * Note that those in the "user variables" section also exist in the System variables -- so think carefully about which one you mean.

* From Windows, method 2
ex
    * `[Windows`]`[R`] to bring up the run dialog and type `sysdm.cpl`

* From Windows, method 3
