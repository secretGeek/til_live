# designs i love

i worked out that as part of working toward creating your branding/personality feel it's good to keep track of the things that catch your eye and which you love.

you can certainly use a site like pinterest for this (or even pinboard/delicious) -- but since i like to use my `til` files for everything i'll just do that instead.
