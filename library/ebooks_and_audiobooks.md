# How to get ebooks and audiobooks from the brisbane library

(This is information I received from 'ask a librarian')

To use the Bolinda/Borrowbox collection, you will first need to create a Bolinda/Borrowbox account. Follow these steps to do this:

 * Go to the library website: [https://library.brisbane.qld.gov.au/](https://library.brisbane.qld.gov.au/)
 * Click on the eBooks and Downloads icon
 * Click on the Audiobooks icon
 * Click on the Bolinda link
 * The Bolinda website will appear. Click on the green Sign in button
 * Sign in with your library barcode and PIN
 * Complete the short registration form that appears
 * Click on Help  to see information about using the collection

 

Links to the Borrowbox app for Androids and iOS devices are on the Audiobooks page.

 

The loan period for Bolinda/Borrowbox items is two weeks. If there are no holds on the item, you can immediately renew it for another two weeks.
